<h1>Nathan Savari</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Nathan. I'm a passionate web artisan dedicated to making the world a better place through well designed products.</p>

<p>With a background in marketing and software development, I strive to create impactful solutions that address environmental and social challenges.</p>
<p>Recently, I've worked with Burger King as a Data Product Owner in order to reduce their packaging waste in France. The aim? To avoid 1.9 tonnes of waste per restaurant per year.</p>
<p>By organising the redesign and optimising the SEO, I have also enabled the Avenir Climatique association's website to increase its average traffic by 400%.</p>
